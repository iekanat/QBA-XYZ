Welcome to QBAXXX, Module 1. 

This module is mainly going to be an introduction to tools we will be using throughout the course. We will make a running start to the semester and it may feel a bit confusing at times, that is on purpose. There will be certain things you won't know from the start. Unless they prevent you from progressing, note them down and keep progressing. Most of it will become clear as you work through it. For the questions that you still are unclear about, you can ask me during our virtual office hours.

This module is made up of 6 learning activites listed below.
