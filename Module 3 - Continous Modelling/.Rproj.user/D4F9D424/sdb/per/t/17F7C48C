First we increased the number of independent variables. Now we will see how the independent variables can work together to determine dependent variable.\n\n# What is the Big Idea?\n\nSometimes the variables work together (or against each other) and have an effect above and beyond their direct (sometimes also called main) effect. Sometimes the effect of a variable is moderated through another variable. This indirect effect is called an interaction (moderation).\n\nLet us discuss the concept of interaction over an example of height of teenagers. We know the height is a function of age in teenagers. Generally speaking, the older the individual the taller he/she will be. *This is the main effect of age.*\n\nAnother factor in height of teenagers is gender. We know, generally speaking, males of our species are taller than females. *That is the main effect of gender.*\n\nLet us say we know that males and females grow at different rates over the years. *The joint effect of gender and age is the interaction effect*.\n\nSo if you believe certain variables enhance, or dampen each other above and beyond their individual main effects, you would be interested in interaction effects.\n\n\n# Dataset\n\nI will create two simulated datasets to use on this learning activity. You can safely ignore the next code block. Just run it, and don't worry too much about it. If you want to know more about it just ask me during virtual office hours.\n\n```{r}\n### Create a dataset for development level\nset.seed(2017) # Set random number seed for replicability\n# Create a simulated dataset\ndevelop <- data.frame(gender = sample(0:1, 100, replace = T), \n                      age = sample(10:18, 100, replace = T))\n# Calculate the height based on other variables\ndevelop$height <- 100 + develop$gender * -20 + (develop$age-10) * 7 + \n  develop$age * develop$gender * 3 + rnorm(mean = 0, sd = 5, 100)\n\n### Create a dataset for rent\n# Set random number seed for replicability\nset.seed(2017)\n# Create a simulated dataset\nrent <- data.frame(beds = sample(1:5, 100, replace = T), \n                   baths = sample(1:2, 100, replace = T), \n                   sqft = round(rnorm(100, mean = 1000, sd = 200)), \n                   hood = sample(LETTERS[1:5], 100, replace = T))\n# Calculate the rent based on other variables\nrent$rent <- 200 + 150 * rent$beds - .50 * rent$sqft + .25 * rent$sqft * rent$beds+\n  50 * rent$baths - 20 * as.numeric(rent$hood) + rnorm(100, mean=0, sd=80)\n# Order the dataset by number of beds\nrent <- rent[order(rent$beds, rent$sqft), ]\n```\n\nThe new dataset develop has `r nrow(develop)` observations. The dataset includes variables for age, gender and height.\n\n```{r}\nsummary(develop)\n```\n\nThe new dataset rent has `r nrow(rent)` observations. It shows the apartments for rent around Athens, OH. The dataset includes the number of bed rooms, number of bathrooms, total surface area, and rent in dollars.\n\n```{r}\nsummary(rent)\n```\n\n\n# How to Estimate Interaction Effects?\n\n## Development Dataset\n\nUnderstanding interaction effects is a little bit easier with binary variables. So I will start with the develop dataset.\n\nOur dependent variable is height of individuals measured in centimeters. We also have age measured in years as an independent variable. \n\nThe independent variable gender is a binary variable. It can only take one of two values (physiologically speaking). In this dataset the genders are coded as 0 for females and 1 for males. This coding is sometimes referred to as dummy coding, and these variables are sometimes called dummy variables.\n\nWe know the height is a function of age in teenagers. Generally speaking, the older the individual the taller he/she will be.\n\nAnother factor in height of teenagers is gender. We know, generally speaking, males of our species are taller than females.\n\nFurthermore, we believe males and females grow at different rates.\n\n*Remember, we believe that the rate of growth per year is different between males and females.* \n\n### 1 - Estimate Main Effects Model\n\nIt is generally advisable to estimate models of increasing complexity rather than estimating the most complex model all at once. This allows you to observe how various variables act together in models. This is especially crucial in models with interactions. \n\nStart with a main effects model, estimating role of gender and age on height.\n\n$height = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\times gender + \\beta_2 \\times age + \\epsilon$\n\n```{r}\ndevelop_lm_0 <- lm(height ~ gender + age, data = develop)\nsummary(develop_lm_0)\n```\n\nHere we see that our model significantly explains `r round(summary(develop_lm_0)$r.squared, digits=2)*100` % of the variance (F(`r unname(summary(develop_lm_0)$fstatistic)[2]`,`r unname(summary(develop_lm_0)$fstatistic)[3]`)=`r round(unname(summary(develop_lm_0)$fstatistic)[1], digits=2)`, p<0.001). THE HIGH $R^2$ IS NOT SURPRISING GIVEN THIS IS A SIMULATED DATASET BUT IN REAL LIFE YOU WOULD RARELY SEE $R^2$ THAT HIGH.\n\nWe see that all three of our variables of interest are statistically significant. **We should just skip the interpretation of the coefficient estimates as they will doubtlessly change in the interaction model. I will still interpret the coefficients, as I want to demonstrate how binary variable is interpreted and what the interaction terms add to the model interpretation.** \n\nWe notice that males (gender=1) are about `r round(unname(develop_lm_0$coefficients[2]), digits=2)` cm taller than females. **Go back to the formula and note $\\beta_1 \\times gender$. Since gender = 0 for females, $\\beta_1$ has no effect on females.**\n\nFinally we see that each year, the individuals grow about `r round(unname(develop_lm_0$coefficients[3]))` cm.\n\n### 2 - Estimate the Interaction Model\n\nSince both our variables are significant in the main effects model, we can go ahead and investiage the interactions. We could not investigate interactions if either one of our main effects were insignificant.\n\nNow let's estimate the interaction model:\n\n$height = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\times gender + \\beta_2 \\times age + \\beta_3 \\times gender \\times age +  \\epsilon$\n\n```{r}\ndevelop_lm_1 <- lm(height ~ gender + age + gender * age, data = develop)\n```\n\nNote that I used asterix (*) to create an interaction term.\n\n```{r}\nsummary(develop_lm_1)\n```\n\nSince there are interaction effects, I can not interpret the main effect of age or gender by themselves. We will talk about how to estimate the effect size later, but for now let us focus on gender x age interaction.\n\n**Very often we would see one or both main effects turn insignificant here (you will see why in our discussion of multicollinearity). As long as interaction term is significant, you need not worry about main effects turning insignificant.**\n\nGoing back to formula, you can calculate height for females as follows:\n\n$height = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\times 0 + \\beta_2 \\times age + \\beta_3 \\times age \\times 0 + \\epsilon \\\\ height = \\beta_0 + \\beta_2 \\times age + \\epsilon$\n\nRemember that gender=0 for females so any coefficients that have gender in their formula don't apply (multiplied by 0) to females.\n\nSo for males, the height would be calculated as:\n\n$height = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\times 1 + \\beta_2 \\times age + \\beta_3 \\times age \\times 1 + \\epsilon \\\\ height = (\\beta_0 + \\beta_1) + (\\beta_2 + \\beta_3)\\times age + \\epsilon$\n\nYou can say $\\beta_0 + \\beta_1$ is the intercept for males and $\\beta_2+\\beta_3$ is the slope of the age for males.\n\nBasically males and females have different intercepts and slopes. Based on above calculations, we can say the females start off at $\\beta_0 =$ `r round(develop_lm_1$coefficients[1], digits=2)` and grow about $\\beta_2 =$ `r round(develop_lm_1$coefficients[3], digits=2)` cm every year.\nMales on the other hand start off at $\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 =$ `r round((develop_lm_1$coefficients[1]+develop_lm_1$coefficients[2]), digits=2)` and grow about $\\beta_2 + \\beta_3 =$ `r round((develop_lm_1$coefficients[3]+develop_lm_1$coefficients[4]), digits=2)` cm each year.\n\nGoing with numerical exploration:\n\nAt age 10, the height of a female would be:\n\n```{r}\npredict(develop_lm_1, newdata = data.frame(gender = 0, age = 10))\n```\n\nRead the manual for predict function. Basically predict takes a model and a dataset and produces estimated values for dependent variables.\n\nAt age 10, the height of a male would be:\n\n```{r}\npredict(develop_lm_1, newdata = data.frame(gender = 1, age = 10))\n```\n\nAt age 18, the height of a female would be:\n\n```{r}\npredict(develop_lm_1, newdata = data.frame(gender = 0, age = 18))\n```\n\nAt age 18, the height of a male would be:\n\n```{r}\npredict(develop_lm_1, newdata = data.frame(gender = 1, age = 18))\n```\n\nOr you can predict multiple values at once such as:\n\n```{r}\nnewDevelop <- data.frame(gender = c(0, 1, 0, 1), age = c(10, 10, 18, 18))\nnewDevelop$estHeight <- predict(develop_lm_1, newdata = newDevelop)\nnewDevelop\n```\n\nLet us visualize this effect:\n\n```{r}\nqplot(x = age, y = estHeight, col = factor(gender), data = newDevelop) +\n  geom_line() +\n  theme_bw()\n```\n\nEasiest way to tell if there is a significant interaction is to look at the lines. If the lines are parallel, there is no significant interaction. In our case the lines are not parallel, hence the interaction is significant.\n\n## Rent Dataset\n\nIn the rent dataset we have two continuous variables we want to interact.\n\nTalking about rent, let us assume we believe peoples preference for size of the house changes with the number of rooms. For example, let us say for a studio apartment, size beyond a certain limit actually decreases the attraction (An empty warehouse is not a very good bedroom). Whereas for houses with more rooms the bigger the area, the better.  We believe there is a relation between room numbers and area that determines rent above and beyond the area or room numbers by themselves. This means we need an interaction model.\n\n### 1- Estimate Main Effects Model\n\nIt is generally advisable to estimate models of increasing complexity rather than estimating the most complex model all at once. This is crucial in models with interactions. Start with a main effects model.\n\n```{r}\nrent_lm_0 <- lm(rent ~ beds + baths + sqft, data = rent)\nsummary(rent_lm_0)\n```\n\nHere we see that our model significantly explains `r round(summary(rent_lm_0)$r.squared, digits=2)*100` % of the variance (F(`r unname(summary(rent_lm_0)$fstatistic)[2]`,`r unname(summary(rent_lm_0)$fstatistic)[3]`)=`r round(unname(summary(rent_lm_0)$fstatistic)[1], digits=2)`, p<0.001).. THE HIGH $R^2$ IS NOT SURPRISING GIVEN THIS IS A SIMULATED DATASET BUT IN REAL LIFE YOU WOULD RARELY SEE $R^2$ THAT HIGH.\n\nWe see that all three of our variables of interest are statistically significant.\n\nRoughly speaking, we see that each bedroom adds \\$ `r round(unname(rent_lm_0$coefficients[2]))` to the rent, while each bathroom adds \\$ `r round(unname(rent_lm_0$coefficients[3]))`. Each square feet increases the rent by about `r round(unname(rent_lm_0$coefficients[4])*100)` cents.\n\n### 2 - Integrate the Interaction Effects\n\nRemember we believe there is a relation between the area and the number of bedrooms. ***Since both main effects were significant in the previous model we can proceed with adding interactions.*** If the main effects were insignificant we could not proceed to second step.\n\n```{r}\nrent_lm_1 <- lm(rent ~ beds + baths + sqft + beds * sqft, data = rent)\nsummary(rent_lm_1)\n```\n\nThis model significantly explains `r round(summary(rent_lm_1)$r.squared, digits = 2) * 100`%  of the variance (F(`r unname(summary(rent_lm_1)$fstatistic)[2]`,`r unname(summary(rent_lm_1)$fstatistic)[3]`)=`r round(unname(summary(rent_lm_1)$fstatistic)[1], digits = 2)`, p<0.001).\n\nWe notice that the coefficients for all main effects and the one interaction we introduced are significant. At this stage, we can note that even if the main effects turn insignificant in the second model we can proceed. *If* the main effects were insignificant, we would have said \"the main effects were fully mediated through the interaction effect.\" Luckily, this is a simple case where all variables are significant.\n\nYou need to note that, in an interaction model **you can't just report the main effects.** You need to take into account the interaction in any form of reporting you take on.\n\nFor now let us simply look at the sign of the interaction effect. The sign of beds x sqft interaction is positive. This means that the number of rooms and size of the house reinforce each other. The bigger the better above and beyond the main effects (note the main effect of sqft actually turned negative here). But how big is the interaction effect? Is it significant enough to counter the negative main effect of the sqft?\n\nAn easy way to understand the interaction effect is to calculate the estimates at various points to see the interaction effects. We will set the interacted variables at low and high levels and calculate rent estimates. We will fix the other variables in the model at mean levels (everything else being constant).\n\nA - Let us hold the baths at mean and sqft at first quartile (%25). \n\n```{r}\nsqft <- unname(quantile(rent$sqft)[2]) # check out the output of quantile function\nbaths <- mean(rent$baths) # fixing baths at mean values\nbeds <- 1:5 # Varying beds from 1 to 5\n# Check out what data.frame(beds, baths, sqft) does\natQ1 <- predict(rent_lm_1, newdata = data.frame(beds, baths, sqft)) \n```\n\nB - Let us hold the sqft and baths constant at mean levels (%50).\n\n```{r}\nsqft <- mean(rent$sqft) # mean level\nbaths <- mean(rent$baths) # mean level\nbeds <- 1:5 # varying 1 to 5\n# estimating rent based on new values\natMean <- predict(rent_lm_1, newdata = data.frame(beds, baths, sqft))\n```\n\nC - Let us hold baths at mean values and sqft at third quartile (%75).\n\n```{r}\nsqft <- unname(quantile(rent$sqft)[4]) # 3rd quartile\nbaths <- mean(rent$baths) # mean level\nbeds <- 1:5 # varying\n# estimating rent\natQ3 <- predict(rent_lm_1, newdata = data.frame(beds, baths, sqft)) \n```\n\nLet us compare the results of varying levels of bed rooms and sqare footage\n\n```{r}\n## Creating a data frame to hold estimates\n# This gets the rent estimates from previous estimations\nestimates<-data.frame(rent = c(atQ1, atMean, atQ3), \n                      # This puts the correct number of beds next to each estimate\n                      beds = rep(1:5, 3), \n                      # This is the sqft used in estimation (Q1, Mean, Q3)\n                      sqft = rep(c(871, 1006, 1116), each=5)) \n# Alternatively you can create a new dataset and save predicted rent values as we did in the develop data.\nestimates # Let us inspect the results\n```\n\nLooking at 15 rows of 3 columns and trying to get a meaning out of it is hard. Let us visualize.\n\n```{r}\nqplot(data = estimates, x = beds, y = rent, col = factor(sqft)) + geom_line()\n```\n\nEasiest way to tell if there is a significant interaction is to look at the lines. If the lines are parallel, there is no significant interaction. In our case the lines are not parallel, hence the interaction is significant.\n\nNow let's interpret the interaction. This is a bit confusing, you get better as you go.\n\nAssuming price reflects preferences: For 1 bedroom houses, people actually prefer cozier (smaller) houses. The effect of sqft is reversed for 3 and more bedrooms, where people actually prefer spacious houses. This reversal in preferences is what we captured in interaction terms.\n\n## What is Next?\n\nIn the next learning activity we will learn about diagnostics of OLS models.\n\n# House Keeping\n\nForgive our dust, here I export some models so we can import them back later.\n\n```{r}\nsave(list = ls(pattern = \"develop*\"), file = \"data/develop_fit\")\nsave(list = ls(pattern = \"rent*\"), file = \"data/rent_fit\")\n```\n",
