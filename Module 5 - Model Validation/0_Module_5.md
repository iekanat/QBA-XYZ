Welcome to MBA6490, Module 5. 

In the previous two modules we learned model fitting in R. In this module we will learn how to validate models and how to automate model fitting to optimize the predictive accuracy. 

This module will build upon some functionality we learned in Modules 3 and 4 so it may be a good idea to refresh your memory.


There will be certain things you won't know from the start. Unless they prevent you from progressing, note them down and keep progressing. Most of it will become clear as you work through it. For the questions that you still are unclear about in the end, you can ask me during our virtual office hours.

This module's module is made up of X learning activitites listed below. **BEFORE YOU START THE FOLLOWING ACTIVITIES, CREATE A PROJECT FOLDER FOR THIS MODULE AS DESCRIBED IN FIRST MODULE'S INTRODUCTION LEARNING ACTIVITY**.
